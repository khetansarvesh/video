# **********  Representation Learning  **********

Now we already know that to do representation learning, we need some learning task, in literature researchers have defined many such tasks on video, some of the prominent ones have been discussed below 

1. [Video Classification Task](https://khetansarvesh.medium.com/video-classification-fc07152ad770) ( Video Level Non-Generative Tasks (Supervised Learning) )

2. Object Tracking (Frame Level Non-Generative Tasks (Supervised Learning)) 
   This is nothing but doing object detection on each frame of the video. We have already seen how to do frame wise tasks [here](https://khetansarvesh.medium.com/video-classification-fc07152ad770#3dd0), you can use a similar approach just that here you will use a object detection image model instead of using a image classifiction model
