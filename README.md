# **********  Representation Learning  **********

Now we already know that to do representation learning we need some learning task, in literature researchers have defined many such tasks on video, some of the prominent ones have been discussed below 

### A . Non-Generative Tasks (Supervised Learning)
1. [Video Classification Task](https://khetansarvesh.medium.com/video-classification-fc07152ad770) (Video Level Task)

2. Object Tracking (Frame Level Task)

    This is nothing but doing object detection on each frame of the video. We have already seen how to do frame wise tasks [here](https://khetansarvesh.medium.com/video-classification-fc07152ad770#3dd0), you can use a similar 
    approach just that here you will use a object detection image model instead of using a image classifiction model 

### B . Generative Tasks (UnSupervised Learning)
1. Video2Video Data Augmentation Task (Video Level Task)
